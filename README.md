# JS-Date-Sorter
A simple JavaScript Date Sorter Table. A vanilla JavaScript Project that takes a name and date input and adds it to a table. 
The third column takes the date you input, calculates the age then adds it to the table. 
This table can be sorted and items can be deleted. There is also a button to delete all the data. 
Dependency free. Uses browser localStorage. The tutorial can be found at https://wp.me/poe8j-3Jf 

## Recommends
Running with VS Code live server extension. It should work on all modern browsers.
